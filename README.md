# Publication_Data_Analysis

Based on the data from Inspire I perform some simple statistical analysis, being interested how factors such as citation count, paper count, number of collaborators vary in time and with sex of the author.

InspireHEP is a High-Energy Physics Literature Database. The data are available here: 
http://inspirehep.net/info/hep/api
I have downloaded the current full dataset, which is available at that site.
